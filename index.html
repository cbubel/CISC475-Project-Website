		<h3>Abstract</h3>

		<p>
		The goal of our project is to create an application that can store student and
		class information that can be manipulated into tables.  Professor Chester will
		manually enter the data into our application. Classes will be assigned based
		off of availablity and skill.  Dr. Chester will also be able to create printable
		excel tables showing the students and their assigned classes.
		</p>

		<h3>Sprint 4</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Delivered code that allows Dr. Chester to edit existing student and course entries in the database</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>Sprint 3</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Met with Dr. Chester to review the first devliverable, solicit his feedback, and discuss his comfort with chosen technologies</li>
			<li>Created new issues based on next feature additions and remaining work from the first deliverable</li>
			<li>Delivered code that allows Dr. Chester to view all students and courses in the database</li>
			<li>Started form validation for course and student addition forms</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Sprint 2</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Communicated with Dr. Chester regarding creating a web app to fulfill his requirements</li>
			<li>Delivered front-end code for two dynamic html forms on the front end of the website</li>
			<li>Delivered code that interfaces with Firebase, our team’s chosen database technology</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Sprint 1</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Met with Dr. Chester to clarify the project description</li>
			<li>Discussed technology options with the client</li>
			<li>Created user stories and epics</li>
			<li>Broke first 2 user stories into trackable Github issues</li>
			<li>Delineated requirements for the first deliverable</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Selected Technologies/Methods</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Web-application
				<ul>
					<li>Javascript/Angular </li>
					<li>HTML/CSS/Bootstrap</li>
					<li>Firebase for data storage</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Issue Tracking
				<ul>
					<li>Github issues</li>
					<li>Github labels</li>
					<li>Github milestones</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Status Communication
				<ul>
					<li>Github pages/hosting</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>Lessons Learned (Deliverable 3)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Don’t neglect taking the time in the beginning to consider how the handoff will be handled
				<ul>
					<li>We did not thoroughly plan out how to transition the Firebase database to our client until the end of the project</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Map out even the simplest of features in the beginning so no “obvious” features are forgotten
				<ul>
					<li>We almost forgot to add a feature for deleting students and courses</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				Towards the end of a project lifecycle, ask the client questions about improving what you have already completed rather than asking what other features he/she would want
			</li>
		</ul>

		<hr COLOR="black">

		<h3>Lessons Learned (Deliverable 2)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid making decisions solely based on asthetic
				<ul>
					<li>We initially used Angular Material to create the front-end code for our forms</li>
					<li>The forms looked beautiful, but it was difficult to integrate the code with the database</li>
					<li>After consulting with the team and client, it was decided to change to Bootstrap, since functionality was a higher priority than asthetics and animations</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Reviewing the prior sprints with the team and client is invaluable
				<ul>
					<li>Being able to recap what worked well and what needed to be improved drastically increased our efficiency and productivity during this deliverable</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Potential Roadblocks (Deliverable 2)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Making sure that we understand all client requirements for matching students with courses</li>
			<li>Understanding exactly what needs to be delivered as part of the final product</li>
			<li>Keeping up our efficient work pace with Thanksgiving and finals approaching</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Next Steps (Deliverable 2)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Define requirements and issues for Sprints 5 and 6</li>
			<li>Sprint review with Dr. Chester and demonstration of second deliverable</li>
			<li>Team sprint retrospective</li>
			<li>Meeting with Dr. Chester to fully understand final product delivery requirements and course/student matching parameters</li>
		</ul>

		<hr COLOR="black">

		<h3>Lessons Learned (Deliverable 1)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid “analysis paralysis” during requirement elicitation
				<ul>
					<li>We spent a lot of time hashing out our user stories and developing them into trackable issues/requirements</li>
					<li>It was important not to go into great depth regarding specific implementation details</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Communicate frequently with the client
				<ul>
					<li>In order to eliminate ambiguity and ensure that functionality is in line with requirements, it was important to communicate early and often with our client</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Potential Roadblocks (Deliverable 1)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Project client in hospital, future meetings need to be over Skype</li>
			<li>Issues with hosting website locally on Chrome, need to use other browser</li>
			<li>Ensuring that our client is okay with each of the specific technologies used (e.g., Angular Material)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Next Steps (Deliverable 1)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Define requirements and issues for sprint 3 and 4</li>
			<li>Sprint review with Dr. Chester and demonstration of first deliverable</li>
			<li>Team sprint retrospective</li>
		</ul>
